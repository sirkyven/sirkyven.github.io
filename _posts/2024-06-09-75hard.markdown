What's the end goal and I'm gonna finish this on August 23rd. <br/>
Goal 1: Show abs on a paddle board on colarado river. <br/>
Goal 2: Increased confidence and online dating opportunities. <br/>
Goal 3: Read more books, if it's a good book I wont' stop at 10 pages so I may end up reading more each day. <br/>


### The Rules:
1. Follow a diet. Zero cheat meals. No alcohol.
2. Workout 2x a day, â‰¥45mins each. 1 workout must be outside.
3. Drink 1 gallon (3.8L) of water.
4. Read 10 pages of a non-fiction self-improvement/business book.
5. Take a progress picture. (If you fail to do any of the above, you restart at Day 1.)


## Day  1:

- Americano with heavy cream.
- Salad with lil bit chicken (gotta cook at home.)
- Reading Getting things done cause I get overwhelmed by number of open loops and also it suprises me that no one teach at school or college on how to get organized, and do a project.
- Also, reading Skin in the game and Lakshman recommended me to read the psychology of money (read notes).
